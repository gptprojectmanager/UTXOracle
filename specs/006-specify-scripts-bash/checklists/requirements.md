## Quality Assessment

### Clarity Score: 8/10
- **Strengths**: Well-structured user stories, clear priorities
- **Issues**: 2 requirements need clarification

### Completeness Score: 9/10
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive coverage of whale detection features
- **Issues**: Missing aggregation and retention specifics

### Testability Score: 9/10
- **Strengths**: Clear acceptance scenarios, measurable success criteria
- **Issues**: Some metrics need baseline data

### Feasibility Score: 10/10
- **Strengths**: Backend already operational, realistic timelines
- **Issues**: None - all requirements achievable

## Action Items

### 🔴 MUST FIX (Blocking)
1. **FR-011**: Define aggregation period (1 minute, 5 minutes, or hourly?)
2. **FR-012**: Define UI retention period (24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days?)

### 🟡 SHOULD IMPROVE (Non-blocking)
1. Consider adding requirement for mobile responsiveness
2. Specify browser compatibility requirements
3. Define accessibility standards (WCAG compliance level)

### 🟢 NICE TO HAVE (Future)
1. Export functionality for whale data
2. Custom alert thresholds
3. Multi-currency support (EUR, GBP)

## Validation Result
